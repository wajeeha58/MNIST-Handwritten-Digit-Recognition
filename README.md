# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

# Problem Statement Data Preparation and Model Building

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in machine learning and computer vision. It involves recognizing and classifying handwritten digits from images into their respective numerical representations (0 to 9). This problem has numerous applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), digitizing historical documents, and automated form processing.

# Objective:
The objective of the first part of this project is to prepare the data and build a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from images. Specifically, we aim to preprocess the dataset, design and implement a machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras, and train the model on the MNIST dataset.

# Approach:

Data Loading: Load the MNIST dataset containing handwritten digit images and their corresponding labels.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by reshaping them and normalizing pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
Model Building: Design and implement a machine learning model (e.g., neural network) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify the digit images.
Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset using appropriate optimization techniques and evaluation metrics.
